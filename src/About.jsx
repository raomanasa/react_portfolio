                    <p>I am Manasa Rao. I live in Stockholm. I completed bootcamp from Craft academy, Stockholm   as Full stack developer. 
                        I am currently working at SouthIndian Ab Stockholm as Intern. 
                        My work at Craft academy and SouthIndian Ab honed my aptitude with object-oriented programming, React.js, Ruby on Rails,Node.js frameworks and testing frameworks such as Rspec, Cypress, Webpack etc.</p>
                    <p>I have experience creating software components using React.js and Ruby on Rails. 
                        I am also familiar with HTML, CSS and Javascripts.
                        I have the ability to design and develop high quality codes and then test these codes to make sure they work correctly. 
                        I also have the experience and training needed to follow and match all specification and coding standards.</p>
<p>If any problem is found during testing, I can find a suitable solution to solve the issue in a fast and efficient manner to keep the project on track. 
    I possess excellent writing skills and the knowledge to keep detailed records of the work being performed.
    My training also includes monitoring and maintaining designs and codes to ensure high quality control for the website.</p>
<p>I also have great interpersonal skills that make it easy to work with a team both
inside and outside the company. If given the chance to become a web developer, I
will bring that same work ethic and drive.
Feel free to call or email for any further information.
