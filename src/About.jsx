                    <p>I am Manasa Rao. I live in Stockholm.I have compleated bootcamp in Craft Acedemy ,Stockholm as full-stack developer. The boot camp here in craft academy has shaped my code
evaluation and website development knowledge, and I have the HTML, CSS, and JS

am also familiar with HTML, CSS and Javascripts. I have the ability to design and
develop high quality codes and then test these codes to make sure they work
correctly. I also have the experience and training needed to follow and match all
specification and coding standards.</p>
<p>If any problem is found during testing, I can find a suitable solution to solve the issue
in a fast and efficient manner to keep the project on track. I possess excellent writing
skills and the knowledge to keep detailed records of the work being performed. My
training also includes monitoring and maintaining designs and codes to ensure high
quality control for the website.</p>
<p>I also have great interpersonal skills that make it easy to work with a team both
inside and outside the company. If given the chance to become a web developer, I
will bring that same work ethic and drive.</p><br/><br/><br/><br/>
